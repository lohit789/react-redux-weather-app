# Weather Web App
This app gets up-to-date and accurate weather forecast information available for the next five days.

This app has been developed to practice my skills with React, Redux and network requests. This project shows you how to:

* use [axios] to make aysncronous network calls.
* parse JSON data and generate model object from the data.
* use [redux-promise]  middleware for handling promises.
* use the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org) API to get weather forecast for 5 days.
